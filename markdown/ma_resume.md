**Kodiak/Crowe** (July 2021 - Present)

Led platform engineering team initially as lead engineer and later as platform architect. Directed initiatives across six development teams and five product offerings to help organization scale software products using clean architecture and domain driven design.

* Guided platform engineering team in adoption of strong Agile development practices. This resulted in producing the highest performing team across the entire organization. This included adoption of test driven development, mob programming practices, and feature management to enable rapid delivery.

* Led effort to migrate microfrontend architecture from Single SPA to Module Federation - introduced asynchronous module loading and enabled dynamic registration of new applications onto platform. Improvements allowed greater testability of frontends, greater autonomy for development teams, and more rapid delivery of feature work.

* Worked alongside enterprise architect to evangelize event sourcing, domain driven design, and CQRS to improve team autonomy, fault resiliency, and scalability across microservice architecture.

* Maintained framework code for both microfrontend and microservice platforms. Introduced new features and improved existing features to improve developer experience.

* Heavily involved in DevOps practices and tooling. Introduced "shift-left" practices to improve code quality and time to market - examples of these include rolling code coverage checks, automated testing of pull requests, and code quality checks.

* Implemented trunk-based development practices with semantic versioning and release management. Introduced feature management tooling to enable greater autonomy for development teams and improved feedback loops between customers and product teams.

* Introduced or expanded on numerous Azure services to reduce management costs and scalability of infrastructure. Of note, Azure API Management, Service Bus, Event Hub with Kafka for real-time data streaming, Docker with Kubernetes for container orchestration and A/B testing, Azure Stream Analytics, and more.

* Pioneered canary release practices to enable refactoring of poorly designed microservices to event-sourced microservices built with domain driven design & the CQRS pattern.

Led development effort on several small-to-medium initiatives for Monster Beverage's accounting practices

* Directed and mentored small team of less experienced engineers to design and implement features for Monster Beverage Co.'s custom accounting platform.

* Created and unit tested numerous n-tier features using ASP.NET WebApi written in C# serving an Angular SPA frontend.

* Tuned Entity Framework Core code to improve performance of database transactions across applications and enable better asynchronous behavior between front and backend.

* Assisted in refactor of reporting functionality to established patterns to be more maintainable and testable.

* Learned Angular to rewrite suite of old WebForms monitoring applications. This was part of a drive to do more application modernization and allowed us to more fully document and migrate legacy applications to newer OS versions and clean up old servers.

* Taught myself ASP.NET and JavaScript to build internationally used, company-wide application monitoring system that integrated with Service Now. This removed the need to have on-call personell working around the clock to monitor and alert support team.

* Created logging application using C#, Winforms, and SQLite database to maintain records on system events and product variances for orders. This allowed a previously pen and paper process to be searchable by part and order number to allow for more thorough auditing and customer response.

* Designed an application to generate customs documentation using Visual Basic and SQL. This application prevented overseas shipments from being seized, opened, and audited and provided documentation for foreign customs official to review for each shipment created in company's order system.

* Developed scanner-integrated quality control systems for business continuity project using Visual Basic. System allowed users to maintain QC logs of thousands of shipments to clients around the globe and eventually was expanded to be used for manual kit-assembly process when the workload exceeded the capacity of the automated assembly line.
