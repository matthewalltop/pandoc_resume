Experience
----------

**Kodiak/Crowe** (July 2021 - Present)

Led platform engineering team initially as lead engineer and later as platform architect. Directed initiatives across nine development teams and five product offerings to help organization scale software products using clean architecture and domain driven design.

* Guided platform engineering team in adoption of strong Agile development practices. This resulted in producing the highest performing team across the entire organization. This included adoption of test driven development, mob programming practices, and feature management to enable rapid delivery.

* Led effort to migrate microfrontend architecture from Single SPA to Module Federation - introduced asynchronous module loading and enabled dynamic registration of new applications onto platform. Improvements allowed greater testability of frontends, greater autonomy for development teams, and more rapid delivery of feature work.

* Worked alongside enterprise architect to evangelize event sourcing, domain driven design, and CQRS to improve team autonomy, fault resiliency, and scalability across microservice architecture.

* Maintained framework code for both microfrontend and microservice platforms. Introduced new features and improved existing features to improve developer experience.

* Heavily involved in DevOps practices and tooling. Introduced "shift-left" practices to improve code quality and time to market - examples of these include rolling code coverage checks, automated testing of pull requests, and code quality checks.

* Implemented trunk-based development practices with semantic versioning and release management. Introduced feature management tooling to enable greater autonomy for development teams and improved feedback loops between customers and product teams.

* Introduced or expanded on numerous Azure services to reduce management costs and scalability of infrastructure. Of note, Azure API Management, Service Bus, Event Hub with Kafka for real-time data streaming, Docker with Kubernetes for container orchestration and A/B testing, Azure Stream Analytics, and more.

* Pioneered canary release practices to enable refactoring of poorly designed microservices to event-sourced microservices built with domain driven design & the CQRS pattern.


* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

**CloudScale** (February 2021-July 2021)
Senior Software (Consultant)

Led development effort on several small-to-medium initiatives for Monster Beverage's accounting practices

* Directed and mentored small team of less experienced engineers to design and implement features for Monster Beverage Co.'s custom accounting platform.

* Created and unit tested numerous n-tier features using ASP.NET WebApi written in C# serving an Angular SPA frontend.

* Tuned Entity Framework Core code to improve performance of database transactions across applications and enable better asynchronous behavior between front and backend.

* Assisted in refactor of reporting functionality to established patterns to be more maintainable and testable.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
